# SARI Reference Data Services

## About

This repository contains the source code for the SARI RDS Platform, which consists of the RDS Global and RDS Local components. Both apps share common services, which for easier integration are set up as apps themselves (e.g. rds-services).

The code here is used to develop the base apps and services that are then built and published as RDS-Global and RDS-Local Docker images.

For use and deployment of those platform, please refer to the respective repositories. These also contain instructions and pipelines for configuring the platform and data.
